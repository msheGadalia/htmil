   <h2>about myself</h2>
   Hello, I am Moshe Gedaliah, 32 years old from Jerusalem, I was born in France in the city of <a href ="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aix-les-Bains"target="black"> Aix-la-Bain</a>  1992. And in 1995 we immigrated to Israel and came straight to Jerusalem and to this day I live in Jerusalem.

I am a person who really likes to travel and hang out and enjoy even small outings, I don't need long and distant outings but small breaks from the routine do  to my a lot of good.

I have several hobbies in life, one of which is to disassembie and build things and chech that everythimg works perfectly as it should, already when I was little I built a radio and a stereo system as well as a small ship that sailed in the pond at 10 km/h.

I have a dream one day to build the mechanical part of the car, I can sit all day in the garage and help disassemble and reassemble in the past I was even accepted to the aerospace industry to disassemble and reassemble airplane engines.

In 2013 I got married and today I am the father of 5 children

<h3>This is my wife and children</h3>

<h2><u>Work Experience</u></h2> 
I worked for a year and a half as a logistics manager for the "Garlitz" bakery on weekends.

From 2015 until today I work at the <a href =" https://youtu.be/LlUAKF7kYkA" target="black">"Mahodar"</a> flour mill, at first I worked there as a logistics manager and after about a year the general manager who was there left and I took the position. During this time I acquired the skill to work in an orderly manner, going down to the smallest details and making sure that everything works as it should,

I acquired team management and organization skills in a very professional and very efficient way (in a way that makes it fun for the employees to work and makes it fun for them in the workplace and on the other hand to get the most out of them and that they will want to give of themselves to the business), taking responsibility, improving and working efficiency, working under great pressure, finding creative solutions to problems and more.

I am a person who is very dedicated to his place of work and gives my all to work and for hours (some would say that is too much), I work in a thorough and professional manner and always strive to do the best possible without concessions My demand from myself is nothing less than excellence
